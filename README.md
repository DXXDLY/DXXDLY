## ðŸ•· About me 

ðŸ•¸ Hello, my name is DXXDLY and I am 18 years old. Since the age of 16, I have been involved in frontend programming and have gained experience in various technologies.

ðŸ•¸ My skills include HTML using the BEM methodology, CSS using SCSS, CSS Modules, and Tailwind, as well as knowledge of JavaScript and TypeScript. I also have experience working with the React library, using Yarn and NPM to manage dependencies, and using linting tools such as ESLint, Prettier, and Stylelint. I am proficient in Git, GitHub, and GitLab, which allows me to effectively collaborate with teams on projects. Additionally, I have experience working with the Redux library and RTK Query.

ðŸ•¸ In addition to programming, I am also involved in electronic music and enjoy creating my own tracks.
